      <h2><strong>1. What is Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?</strong></h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</strong> is a chronic mental health condition characterized by two main components:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Obsessions:</strong> unwanted, intrusive, and distressing thoughts, images, or urges</li>
        <li><strong>Compulsions:</strong> repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed to reduce anxiety caused by obsessions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        People with OCD are usually aware that their thoughts or behaviors are irrational, yet they feel unable to stop them. This cycle can consume hours daily and interfere with work, education, relationships, and overall wellbeing.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Common Misconceptions About OCD</strong></h3>

      <p>Many people misunderstand OCD. Common myths include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"OCD means being neat and clean"</li>
        <li>"People with OCD are just perfectionists"</li>
        <li>"OCD is a habit, not an illness"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In reality, OCD is a serious medical condition linked to anxiety and brain functioning, not a choice or personality trait.</p>
